# Overview

I am hoping to learn and understand more languages, so I have a good base knowledge of them. I am also hoping to get familiar with the language Kotlin. In the future I may build apps, and I know Kotlin is a good option for that.
My program simulates an online shopping cart. It has two classes. One represents the cart itself and the other represents the item that can be added to the cart and be purchased. 

# Purpose of this Software
I wanted to write a program that uses some of the basics of Kotlin to gain familiar with how they do it. I thought this program could be a good reference for any of my future work using Kotlin. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used the development kit JDK and Intellij to develop this software, and I wrote my code in Kotlin. 

# Useful Websites

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)

# Future Work

* In the future, I would like to print the dollar amount to only two decimal places.
* I would also like to add more items to the shopping cart, so the user could have many option. I could maybe use database to store the items.
